                    and how manipulating the specifications of the storage device affects the this and ultimately the customer's energy bills and attributable carbon

                      in 2021, and will drop to 10 percent from 2022 onward (for non-residential installations). If an energy storage device is charged with renewable energy from a

                      particularly for small- to medium-scale installations. For this reason, vendors may offer self-maintenance options. When the vendor is on-site during battery 
                      installation, they can train employees or members of the host site to do much of the basic, routine maintenance. If a larger issue arises that may need more 
                      specialized attention, the vendor can come to the site to do incidental maintenance, but the majority of the regular maintenance can be done in-house by the 
                      host site. This may be of particular interest or relevance to battery owners or hosts with an educational interest or mission or with particular skill with
